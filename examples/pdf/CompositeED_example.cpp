/*
  Pdfs containing independent components for example:
        P(E, r, t) = P(E) * P(r) * P(t)
  are dealt with using the CompositeED class. Just create the pdfs
  independently and then multiply them together to get a composite pdf.

  If you've correctly set the data representation of all the constituents
  you can call compositeED.Probability(anEvent) and each of the consitent
  pdfs will work out what to do!

  In this example we combine a 2D gaussian analytic pdf,
  with a 1D gaussian analytic pdf to produce  a 3D pdf.
  ANY OTHER class implementing the PDF interface would work
  in exactly the same way.
